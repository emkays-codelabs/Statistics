📊 Chi-Square Test (χ²)
🔹 Definition

The Chi-Square test is a statistical method used to find out whether the difference between observed data and expected data is due to chance or is statistically significant.

It is mainly used for categorical (qualitative) data and works with frequencies, not numerical averages.

🔹 Purpose of the Chi-Square Test

The chi-square test helps to:

Check if observed results match expected results

Determine whether two categorical variables are related

Test assumptions about population distributions

🔹 Types of Chi-Square Tests
1️⃣ Chi-Square Goodness-of-Fit Test

Used to check whether observed frequencies follow a given theoretical distribution.

Example:
Do students like all subjects equally?

2️⃣ Chi-Square Test of Independence

Used to examine whether two categorical variables are associated with each other.

Example:
Is gender related to exam performance?

📝 Example: Chi-Square Goodness-of-Fit Test
📌 Problem

A teacher thinks that students like Math, Science, and English equally.
She surveys 90 students to find their favorite subject.

📊 Observed Frequencies
Subject	Observed (O)
Math	50
Science	30
English	10
Total	90
🔹 Step 1: Hypotheses

Null Hypothesis (H₀):
Students prefer all three subjects equally.

Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):
Students do not prefer all subjects equally.

🔹 Step 2: Expected Frequencies

If preferences are equal:

🔹 Step 5: Decision

At 5% significance level (α = 0.05):

Critical χ² value for df = 2 → 5.99

Calculated χ² = 26.66

Since 26.66 > 5.99, the null hypothesis is rejected.

✅ Final Conclusion

There is a significant difference between observed and expected frequencies.
Students do not prefer all subjects equally.
Math is the most preferred subject.

🔹 Assumptions of the Chi-Square Test

Data must be categorical

Observations must be independent

Expected frequency should be at least 5

Sample should be randomly selected

🔹 Advantages

Simple to understand and apply

No need for normal distribution

Useful for large samples

🔹 Limitations

Not suitable for small samples

Only works with categorical data

Does not measure strength of relationship

🔑 Key Point

The chi-square test checks whether observed differences are real or happened by chance.
