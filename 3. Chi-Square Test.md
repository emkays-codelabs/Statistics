# 📊 Chi-Square Test (χ²)

## 🔹 Definition
The **Chi-Square test** is a statistical test used to determine whether there is a **significant relationship between categorical variables** or whether the **difference between observed and expected frequencies** occurs by chance.

It is mainly used for **categorical (qualitative) data** such as gender, subject choice, preferences, etc.

---

## 🔹 Type of Chi-Square Test Used
### ✅ Chi-Square Test of Independence
This test is used to check whether **two categorical variables are independent or related**.

---

# 📝 Example: Do Boys and Girls Like Subjects Equally?

## 📌 Problem Statement
A school wants to find out whether **boys and girls have the same subject preferences**.

Students are asked to choose their favorite subject:
- Math
- Science

A total of **100 students** participate in the survey.

---

## 📊 Observed Frequencies (O)

| Gender | Math | Science | Total |
|------|------|---------|------|
| Boys | 40 | 10 | 50 |
| Girls | 20 | 30 | 50 |
| **Total** | **60** | **40** | **100** |

---

## 🔹 Step 1: Hypotheses

- **Null Hypothesis (H₀):**  
  Gender and subject preference are independent.  
  (Boys and girls like subjects equally.)

- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):**  
  Gender and subject preference are not independent.  
  (Boys and girls do not like subjects equally.)

---

## 🔹 Step 2: Expected Frequencies (E)

\[
E = \frac{(\text{Row Total} \times \text{Column Total})}{\text{Grand Total}}
\]

### Expected Frequency Table

| Gender | Math (E) | Science (E) |
|------|------|------|
| Boys | (50 × 60) / 100 = 30 | (50 × 40) / 100 = 20 |
| Girls | (50 × 60) / 100 = 30 | (50 × 40) / 100 = 20 |

---

## 🔹 Step 3: Calculation of Chi-Square Value

\[
\chi^2 = \sum \frac{(O - E)^2}{E}
\]

| Category | O | E | (O − E)² / E |
|------|----|----|--------------|
| Boys – Math | 40 | 30 | 3.33 |
| Boys – Science | 10 | 20 | 5.00 |
| Girls – Math | 20 | 30 | 3.33 |
| Girls – Science | 30 | 20 | 5.00 |

\[
\chi^2 = 16.66
\]

---

## 🔹 Step 4: Degrees of Freedom

\[
df = (r - 1)(c - 1) = (2 - 1)(2 - 1) = 1
\]

---

## 🔹 Step 5: Decision Rule

At **5% level of significance (α = 0.05)**:
- Critical χ² value for df = 1 = **3.84**
- Calculated χ² value = **16.66**

Since **16.66 > 3.84**, the null hypothesis is rejected.

---

## ✅ Final Conclusion
There is a **significant relationship between gender and subject preference**.

- Boys prefer **Math** more.
- Girls prefer **Science** more.

Therefore, boys and girls **do not like subjects equally**.

---

## 🔹 Assumptions of the Chi-Square Test
- Data must be categorical.
- Observations must be independent.
- Expected frequency in each cell should be at least 5.
- Data should be collected randomly.

---

## 🔹 Advantages
- Simple and easy to use.
- No assumption of normal distribution.
- Suitable for large sample sizes.

---

## 🔹 Limitations
- Not suitable for small samples.
- Only applicable to categorical data.
- Does not measure the strength of association.

---

## 🔑 Key Exam Point
> The chi-square test of independence is used to determine whether two categorical variables are related.
