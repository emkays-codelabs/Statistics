# Levels of Measurement

## Introduction

In statistics, data analysis, and data science, **levels of measurement** define how data is classified, compared, and analyzed. Choosing the correct level is critical because it determines:

* What mathematical operations are valid
* Which statistical measures can be used
* How data should be stored, queried, and modeled

There are **four standard levels of measurement**:

1. Nominal
2. Ordinal
3. Interval
4. Ratio

These levels move from **least informative to most informative**.

## 1. Nominal Scale

### Definition

Nominal data is used for **categorization only**. Values act as **labels or names** and do not have any order or numerical meaning.

### Characteristics

* Categories only
* No inherent order
* No arithmetic operations allowed
* Equality comparison only

### Common Examples

* Gender (Male, Female)
* Blood Group (A, B, AB, O)
* Country (India, USA, UK)
* Department (HR, IT, Sales)
* Product Category

### Valid Statistics

* Frequency count
* Mode

### Invalid Operations

* Mean, Median
* Greater than / Less than comparisons

### Example Explanation

If a company has departments **IT** and **HR**, we can count employees in each department, but we **cannot say IT > HR**.

### SQL Example

```sql
SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS employee_count
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;
```

### Python Example

```python
import pandas as pd

depts = pd.Series(['IT', 'HR', 'IT', 'Sales'])
print(depts.value_counts())
```

## 2. Ordinal Scale

### Definition

Ordinal data represents **ordered categories**, but the **distance between values is not measurable or consistent**.

### Characteristics

* Categories with ranking
* Order matters
* Differences are undefined
* Arithmetic operations not allowed

### Common Examples

* Education Level (High School < Bachelor < Master < PhD)
* Customer Satisfaction (Poor < Average < Good < Excellent)
* Movie Ratings (⭐ to ⭐⭐⭐⭐)
* Socioeconomic Status (Low, Middle, High)

### Valid Statistics

* Median
* Percentiles
* Rank comparisons

### Invalid Operations

* Mean
* Standard deviation

### Example Explanation

"Excellent" is better than "Good", but we **cannot measure how much better**.

### SQL Example

```sql
SELECT customer_id, satisfaction_level
FROM feedback
ORDER BY satisfaction_level;
```

### Python Example

```python
import pandas as pd

ratings = pd.Categorical(
    ['Good', 'Excellent', 'Average'],
    categories=['Poor', 'Average', 'Good', 'Excellent'],
    ordered=True
)
print(ratings.sort_values())
```

## 3. Interval Scale

### Definition

Interval data has **ordered values with equal intervals**, but **no true zero point**.

### Characteristics

* Ordered
* Equal spacing between values
* Zero does not indicate absence
* Ratios are meaningless

### Common Examples

* Temperature (°C, °F)
* Calendar Years
* IQ Scores
* Standardized Test Scores

### Valid Statistics

* Mean
* Median
* Standard Deviation
* Addition and Subtraction

### Invalid Operations

* Ratio comparisons (twice, half)

### Example Explanation

20°C is warmer than 10°C by the same amount as 30°C is warmer than 20°C, but **30°C is not twice as hot as 15°C**.

### SQL Example

```sql
SELECT AVG(temperature_celsius) AS avg_temperature
FROM weather_data;
```

### Python Example

```python
import numpy as np

temps = np.array([20, 25, 30])
print('Mean:', temps.mean())
print('Difference:', temps[2] - temps[0])
```

---

## 4. Ratio Scale

### Definition

Ratio data includes **all properties of interval data plus a true zero**, enabling meaningful ratio comparisons.

### Characteristics

* Ordered
* Equal intervals
* True zero exists
* All arithmetic operations valid

### Common Examples

* Height (cm)
* Weight (kg)
* Age (years)
* Salary (₹)
* Distance (km)
* Sales Revenue

### Valid Statistics

* Mean, Median, Mode
* Standard Deviation
* Ratios and percentages

### Example Explanation

If one employee earns ₹40,000 and another earns ₹20,000, the first earns **twice as much**.

### SQL Example

```sql
SELECT employee_name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary > 50000;
```

### Python Example

```python
import numpy as np

salaries = np.array([20000, 40000, 80000])
print('Average Salary:', salaries.mean())
print('Salary Ratio:', salaries[2] / salaries[0])
```

## Comparison Summary

| Level    | Order | Equal Intervals | True Zero | Typical Examples |
| -------- | ----- | --------------- | --------- | ---------------- |
| Nominal  | ❌     | ❌               | ❌         | Gender, Country  |
| Ordinal  | ✅     | ❌               | ❌         | Rankings         |
| Interval | ✅     | ✅               | ❌         | Temperature      |
| Ratio    | ✅     | ✅               | ✅         | Salary, Age      |

## Why Levels of Measurement Matter

* Prevents incorrect statistical analysis
* Determines encoding techniques in ML
* Guides SQL aggregations and calculations

### Data Science Mapping

* Nominal → One-Hot Encoding
* Ordinal → Ordinal / Label Encoding
* Interval & Ratio → Scaling, Normalization

## Memory Trick

**NOIR**

* N → Nominal
* O → Ordinal
* I → Interval
* R → Ratio

# Simple rule to remember

| Measure | Needs Order | Needs Equal Distance | Valid for Ordinal |
| ------- | ----------- | -------------------- | ----------------- |
| Mode    | ❌           | ❌                    | ✅                 |
| Median  | ✅           | ❌                    | ✅                 |
| Mean    | ✅           | ✅                    | ❌                 |

## Final Notes

Understanding levels of measurement ensures **correct analysis, valid conclusions, and better models**. Misclassification leads to misleading results, especially in analytics and machine learning.
