# Levels of Measurement

In statistics and data science, **levels of measurement** describe how data values are categorized, ordered, and quantified. Understanding them is critical because they determine **which statistical operations and analyses are valid**.

There are **four main levels of measurement**:

1. Nominal
2. Ordinal
3. Interval
4. Ratio

---

## 1. Nominal Scale

### Definition

Nominal data represents **categories or labels** with **no inherent order**. The values are simply names.

### Key Characteristics

* No ordering or ranking
* No mathematical operations allowed
* Only equality/inequality comparisons (==, !=)

### Examples

* Gender: Male, Female
* Blood group: A, B, AB, O
* Country names: India, USA, UK
* Department: HR, IT, Sales

### Valid Operations

* Counting frequencies
* Mode

### Example

```text
Employee Department
A → IT
B → HR
C → IT
```

You can count how many employees are in IT, but you **cannot say IT > HR**.

## 2. Ordinal Scale

### Definition

Ordinal data represents **categories with a meaningful order**, but **differences between values are not measurable**.

### Key Characteristics

* Ordered or ranked
* Differences are not uniform
* Arithmetic operations are invalid

### Examples

* Education level: High School < Bachelor < Master < PhD
* Customer satisfaction: Poor < Average < Good < Excellent
* Movie ratings: ⭐ < ⭐⭐ < ⭐⭐⭐ < ⭐⭐⭐⭐

### Valid Operations

* Comparison (>, <)
* Median
* Percentiles

### Example

```text
Customer Rating
Customer A → Good
Customer B → Excellent
```

We know *Excellent > Good*, but **how much better** is unknown.

---

## 3. Interval Scale

### Definition

Interval data has **ordered values with equal intervals**, but **no true zero**.

### Key Characteristics

* Ordered
* Equal differences between values
* Zero does NOT mean absence
* Ratios are meaningless

### Examples

* Temperature (°C, °F)
* Calendar years
* IQ scores

### Valid Operations

* Addition and subtraction
* Mean and standard deviation

### Example

```text
Temperature
10°C → 20°C → 30°C
```

Difference between 10°C and 20°C is the same as 20°C and 30°C, but **30°C is not “twice as hot” as 15°C**.

---

## 4. Ratio Scale

### Definition

Ratio data has **all properties of interval data plus a true zero**, allowing meaningful ratios.

### Key Characteristics

* Ordered
* Equal intervals
* True zero exists
* All arithmetic operations allowed

### Examples

* Height (cm)
* Weight (kg)
* Age (years)
* Salary (₹)
* Distance (km)

### Valid Operations

* Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
* Mean, median, standard deviation

### Example

```text
Salary
Employee A → ₹20,000
Employee B → ₹40,000
```

Employee B earns **twice** as much as Employee A.

## Comparison Summary

| Level    | Order | Equal Intervals | True Zero | Examples        |
| -------- | ----- | --------------- | --------- | --------------- |
| Nominal  | ❌     | ❌               | ❌         | Gender, Country |
| Ordinal  | ✅     | ❌               | ❌         | Rankings        |
| Interval | ✅     | ✅               | ❌         | Temperature     |
| Ratio    | ✅     | ✅               | ✅         | Salary, Age     |

## Why Levels of Measurement Matter

* Choose correct statistical tests
* Avoid incorrect conclusions
* Essential for data science & ML feature selection

### Example Impact

* **Nominal** → One-hot encoding
* **Ordinal** → Label encoding
* **Interval/Ratio** → Normalization, scaling

## Quick Memory Trick

**NOIR**

* N → Nominal
* O → Ordinal
* I → Interval
* R → Ratio

## SQL & Python Examples by Level of Measurement

### 1. Nominal Scale – SQL & Python

#### SQL Example

```sql
-- Count employees by department (nominal data)
SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS total_employees
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;
```

#### Python Example

```python
import pandas as pd

data = pd.Series(['IT', 'HR', 'IT', 'Sales'])
print(data.value_counts())
```

---

### 2. Ordinal Scale – SQL & Python

#### SQL Example

```sql
-- Customer satisfaction stored as ordinal values
SELECT customer_id, satisfaction_level
FROM feedback
ORDER BY satisfaction_level;
```

#### Python Example

```python
import pandas as pd

ratings = pd.Categorical(
    ['Good', 'Excellent', 'Average'],
    categories=['Poor', 'Average', 'Good', 'Excellent'],
    ordered=True
)
print(ratings.sort_values())
```

---

### 3. Interval Scale – SQL & Python

#### SQL Example

```sql
-- Calculate average temperature (interval data)
SELECT AVG(temperature_celsius) AS avg_temp
FROM weather_data;
```

#### Python Example

```python
import numpy as np

temps = np.array([20, 25, 30])
print('Mean:', temps.mean())
print('Difference:', temps[2] - temps[0])
```

---

### 4. Ratio Scale – SQL & Python

#### SQL Example

```sql
-- Salary comparison (ratio data)
SELECT employee_name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary > 50000;
```

#### Python Example

```python
import numpy as np

salaries = np.array([20000, 40000, 80000])
print('Mean salary:', salaries.mean())
print('Ratio:', salaries[2] / salaries[0])
```

## Final Notes

* Nominal & Ordinal → **Categorical features**
* Interval & Ratio → **Numerical features**
* Correct level = correct analysis
