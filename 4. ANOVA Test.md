## 📌 What is ANOVA?

**ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)** is a statistical method used to:

> Compare the **means of three or more groups**  
> to check whether **at least one group mean is significantly different**.

Instead of comparing means directly, ANOVA compares **variances**.

---

## 🎯 Why ANOVA is Used

- To compare **3 or more groups**  
- To avoid multiple t-tests  
- To reduce **Type I error**  
- To study treatment effects

## 🔢 Important Symbols

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| k | Number of groups |
| n | Observations in each group |
| N | Total observations (N = k × n) |
| X̄ᵢ | Mean of each group |
| X̄ | Overall mean |

---

## 🧪 Hypotheses in ANOVA

### 🔹 Null Hypothesis (H₀)

H₀ : μ₁ = μ₂ = μ₃  

All group means are equal.  
No real difference exists.

---

### 🔹 Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)

H₁ : At least one mean is different  

At least one group mean is different.  
A real difference exists.

## 📚 Types of ANOVA

### 1️⃣ One-Way ANOVA
- One independent variable  
- Compares **3 or more groups**  
- Example: Teaching methods (A, B, C)

### 2️⃣ Two-Way ANOVA
- Two independent variables  
- Studies **interaction effects**  
- Example: Teaching method + Gender

### 3️⃣ Repeated Measures ANOVA
- Same group tested multiple times  
- Example: Before & after training

### 4️⃣ MANOVA
- Multiple dependent variables  
- Example: Marks + Attendance

---

## 📊 Example: Teaching Methods (One-Way ANOVA)

| Method A | Method B | Method C |
|----------|----------|----------|
| 70 | 78 | 65 |
| 72 | 80 | 67 |
| 68 | 75 | 66 |

k = 3, n = 3, N = 9

---

## 📐 Step 1: Group Means

Mean A = (70 + 72 + 68) / 3 = **70**  
Mean B = (78 + 80 + 75) / 3 = **77.67**  
Mean C = (65 + 67 + 66) / 3 = **66**

---

## 📐 Step 2: Overall Mean

X̄ = (70 + 72 + 68 + 78 + 80 + 75 + 65 + 67 + 66) / 9  
X̄ = **71.67**

---

## 🧮 ANOVA Calculations (With Formulas)

---

### 1️⃣ SSB – Sum of Squares Between

**Formula:**

SSB = Σ n (X̄ᵢ − X̄)²  

**Calculation:**

SSB = 3(70 − 71.67)²  
+ 3(77.67 − 71.67)²  
+ 3(66 − 71.67)²  

SSB = **212.66**

df(B) = k − 1 = **2**

---

### 2️⃣ MSB – Mean Square Between

MSB = SSB / df(B)  
MSB = 212.66 / 2  
MSB = **106.33**

---

### 3️⃣ SSW – Sum of Squares Within

**Formula:**

SSW = Σ (X − X̄group)²  

Method A:  
(70−70)² + (72−70)² + (68−70)² = **8**

Method B:  
(78−77.67)² + (80−77.67)² + (75−77.67)² = **12.66**

Method C:  
(65−66)² + (67−66)² + (66−66)² = **2**

SSW = 8 + 12.66 + 2  
SSW = **22.66**

df(W) = N − k = **6**

---

### 4️⃣ MSW – Mean Square Within

MSW = SSW / df(W)  
MSW = 22.66 / 6  
MSW = **3.78**

---

### 5️⃣ F-Value

F = MSB / MSW  
F = 106.33 / 3.78  
F = **28.12**

---

## 📊 Decision Rule

At α = 0.05  
df(B) = 2  
df(W) = 6  

F-critical ≈ **5.14**

Since:

28.12 > 5.14  

➡ Reject H₀

---

## ✅ Final Conclusion

There is a **significant difference** in student marks among the three teaching methods.  
At least one method is more effective.

## 📋 ANOVA Summary Table

| Source | SS | df | MS | F |
|--------|----|----|----|----|
| Between | 212.66 | 2 | 106.33 | 28.12 |
| Within | 22.66 | 6 | 3.78 | |
| Total | 235.32 | 8 | | |

## 🧠 Easy Memory Trick

k → groups  
n → per group  
N → total  
SSB → between  
SSW → within  
MSB → mean between  
MSW → mean within
