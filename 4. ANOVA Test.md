## 📌 What is ANOVA?

**ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)** is a statistical method used to:

> Compare the **means of three or more groups**  
> to check whether **at least one group mean is significantly different**.

Instead of comparing means directly, ANOVA compares **variations (variances)**.

---

## 🎯 Why ANOVA is Used

- To compare **3 or more groups**  
- To avoid multiple t-tests  
- To reduce **Type I error**  
- To study treatment effects

## 🔢 Important Symbols

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **k** | Number of groups |
| **n** | Observations in each group |
| **N** | Total observations (N = k × n) |
| **X̄ᵢ** | Mean of each group |
| **X̄** | Overall mean |

---

## 🧪 Hypotheses in ANOVA

### 🔹 Null Hypothesis (H₀)

**H₀ : μ₁ = μ₂ = μ₃**

All group means are equal.  
There is **no real difference** between groups.

---

### 🔹 Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)

**H₁ : At least one mean is different**

At least one group mean is different.  
A **real difference exists**.

---

## 📊 Example: Teaching Methods (3 Groups)

| Method A | Method B | Method C |
|----------|----------|----------|
| 70 | 78 | 65 |
| 72 | 80 | 67 |
| 68 | 75 | 66 |

Here:
- k = 3 (groups)  
- n = 3 (students per group)  
- N = 9 (total students)

---

## 📐 Step 1: Group Means

Mean of Method A = (70 + 72 + 68) / 3 = **70**  
Mean of Method B = (78 + 80 + 75) / 3 = **77.67**  
Mean of Method C = (65 + 67 + 66) / 3 = **66**

---

## 📐 Step 2: Overall Mean

Overall Mean (X̄)  
= (70 + 72 + 68 + 78 + 80 + 75 + 65 + 67 + 66) / 9  
= **71.67**

---

## 🧮 ANOVA Calculations (With Formulas)

---

### 1️⃣ SSB – Sum of Squares Between

**Formula:**

SSB = Σ n (X̄ᵢ − X̄)²  

**Calculation:**

SSB = 3(70 − 71.67)²  
  + 3(77.67 − 71.67)²  
  + 3(66 − 71.67)²  

SSB = 3(2.78) + 3(36) + 3(32.11)  
SSB = **212.66**

**Degrees of Freedom:**

df(B) = k − 1 = 3 − 1 = **2**

---

### 2️⃣ MSB – Mean Square Between

**Formula:**

MSB = SSB / df(B)

**Calculation:**

MSB = 212.66 / 2  
MSB = **106.33**

---

### 3️⃣ SSW – Sum of Squares Within

**Formula:**

SSW = Σ (X − X̄group)²  

**Method A:**

(70 − 70)² + (72 − 70)² + (68 − 70)²  
= 0 + 4 + 4 = **8**

**Method B:**

(78 − 77.67)² + (80 − 77.67)² + (75 − 77.67)²  
= 0.11 + 5.44 + 7.11 = **12.66**

**Method C:**

(65 − 66)² + (67 − 66)² + (66 − 66)²  
= 1 + 1 + 0 = **2**

**Total SSW:**

SSW = 8 + 12.66 + 2  
SSW = **22.66**

**Degrees of Freedom:**

df(W) = N − k = 9 − 3 = **6**

---

### 4️⃣ MSW – Mean Square Within

**Formula:**

MSW = SSW / df(W)

**Calculation:**

MSW = 22.66 / 6  
MSW = **3.78**

---

### 5️⃣ F-Value

**Formula:**

F = MSB / MSW  

**Calculation:**

F = 106.33 / 3.78  
F = **28.12**

---

## 📊 Decision Rule

At:

- α = 0.05  
- df(B) = 2  
- df(W) = 6  

F-critical ≈ **5.14**

Since:

**28.12 > 5.14**

➡ Reject **H₀**

---

## ✅ Final Conclusion

There is a **significant difference** in student marks among the three teaching methods.  
At least one method is more effective.

## 📋 ANOVA Summary Table

| Source | SS | df | MS | F |
|--------|----|----|----|----|
| Between | 212.66 | 2 | 106.33 | 28.12 |
| Within | 22.66 | 6 | 3.78 | |
| Total | 235.32 | 8 | | |

## 🧠 Easy Memory Trick

- k → number of groups  
- n → students per group  
- N → total students  
- SSB → Between groups  
- SSW → Within groups  
- MSB → Mean Between  
- MSW → Mean Within
