## 📌 What is ANOVA?

**ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)** is a statistical method used to:

> Compare the **means of three or more groups**  
> to check whether **at least one group mean is significantly different**.

Instead of comparing means directly, ANOVA compares **variations (variances)**.

---

## 🎯 Why ANOVA is Used

- To compare **3 or more groups**  
- To avoid multiple t-tests  
- To reduce **Type I error**  
- To study treatment effects

## 🔢 Important Symbols

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **k** | Number of groups |
| **n** | Observations in each group |
| **N** | Total observations (N = k × n) |
| **X̄ᵢ** | Mean of each group |
| **X̄** | Overall mean |

## 🧪 Hypotheses in ANOVA

Before performing ANOVA, we set two hypotheses.

### 🔹 Null Hypothesis (H₀)

**H₀ : μ₁ = μ₂ = μ₃**

**Meaning:**  
All group means are **equal**.

This means:
- No real difference exists  
- Any difference is due to random chance  
- The treatment has no effect  

**Example:**  
If three teaching methods give similar marks, we assume:  
> All methods are equally effective.

---

### 🔹 Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)

**H₁ : At least one mean is different**

**Meaning:**  
At least one group mean is **not equal** to the others.

This means:
- A real difference exists  
- The treatment has an effect  
- Not all groups perform the same  

⚠ ANOVA does **not** tell us *which* group is different —  
only that **a difference exists**.

## 📊 Example: Teaching Methods (3 Groups)

A teacher wants to compare **three teaching methods**.

| Method A | Method B | Method C |
|----------|----------|----------|
| 70 | 78 | 65 |
| 72 | 80 | 67 |
| 68 | 75 | 66 |

Here:
- **k = 3** (methods)  
- **n = 3** (students per group)  
- **N = 9** (total students)

---

## 📐 Step 1: Group Means

| Method | Mean |
|--------|------|
| A | 70 |
| B | 77.67 |
| C | 66 |

---

## 📐 Step 2: Overall Mean

Overall Mean (X̄) = **71.67**

---

## 🧮 ANOVA Calculations (Step by Step)

### 1️⃣ SSB – Sum of Squares Between

**Meaning:**  
Variation between group means and the overall mean.

**Value:**  
SSB = **212.66**

**Degrees of Freedom:**  
df₍B₎ = k − 1 = **2**

---

### 2️⃣ MSB – Mean Square Between

**Meaning:**  
Average variation between groups.

MSB = SSB / df₍B₎  
MSB = **106.33**

---

### 3️⃣ SSW – Sum of Squares Within

**Meaning:**  
Variation inside each group.

SSW = **22.66**

**Degrees of Freedom:**  
df₍W₎ = N − k = **6**

---

### 4️⃣ MSW – Mean Square Within

**Meaning:**  
Average variation within groups (error).

MSW = SSW / df₍W₎  
MSW = **3.78**

---

### 5️⃣ F-Value

F = MSB / MSW  
F = **28.12**

---

## 📊 Decision Rule

At:

- α = 0.05  
- df₍B₎ = 2  
- df₍W₎ = 6  

F-critical ≈ **5.14**

Since:

**28.12 > 5.14**

➡ Reject **H₀**

---

## ✅ Final Conclusion

> There is a **significant difference** in student marks among the three teaching methods.  
> At least one method is more effective.

## 📋 ANOVA Summary Table

| Source | SS | df | MS | F |
|--------|----|----|----|----|
| Between | 212.66 | 2 | 106.33 | 28.12 |
| Within | 22.66 | 6 | 3.78 | |
| Total | 235.32 | 8 | | |

## 🧠 Easy Memory Trick

- **k** → number of groups  
- **n** → students per group  
- **N** → total students  
- **SSB** → Between groups  
- **SSW** → Within groups  
- **MSB** → Mean Between  
- **MSW** → Mean Within
